# --- Structure: the course's own order, in three sections -----------------
# Pages follow the syllabus and are grouped in the navigation as the course
# is: The Nativity, Prediction, and the reference pages.
# Nothing is hidden. The lesson gate that used to hide pages by lesson
# number went on 2026-09-10 (UI_REVIEW_2026-09-10.md §1): the course
# reviews later material early -- the Lesson 5 warm-ups are the planets
# and their places, the Dignities page -- so a filter by lesson number hid
# exactly what the lecture was using, and a page a student is not ready
# for is simply a page not opened. What restrains the pages now is the
# Sources shown reading on the Sources page, which folds the supplement.

# The viewer's theme, read once for the pictures. Streamlit 1.62 reports
# it as st.context.theme.type -- "dark", "light", or None when the browser
# has not said yet (and under AppTest, which has no browser at all). It is
# not by itself what a picture is drawn in: the owner's ruling is that the
# wheels keep their white ground in every theme unless the reader asks
# otherwise, so this is read here and consulted only when the Dark wheel
# preference is on (WHEEL_THEME, below with the other readings).

# --- The natal wheel, clickable -------------------------------------------
# The Chart page's wheel is mounted as an st.components.v2 component rather
# than shown with st.image, so that a click on a planet or a sign can reach
# Python. The component is registered ONCE, here at the module level: a
# registration wrapped up with its own mounting would re-register the name
# on every instance, which the API warns against. It is mounted inside the
# Chart page's fragment, so a click reruns that fragment and not the page.
#
# What the component is handed is the SVG the app's own renderer produced,
# with every value already escaped at the point it was written (_esc_attr,
# _esc_text). No string from the sidebar, from a saved chart's name or from
# a place label is ever put into the html, css or js below -- those are
# component code, which Streamlit does not sanitise, and they are constants
# written here. User strings reach the component only inside `data`, which
# is data.
#
# The CSS styles the wrapper, the expand control and the hover tooltip and
# NOTHING inside the picture: the wheel carries its own palette, light or
# dark, and a component that recoloured it would be overruling the reader's
# own Dark wheel preference. Styles are isolated in a shadow root
# (isolate_styles defaults to True), so none of this reaches the app.

    Standard time, so the sidebar's own zone branch resolves the same

# Provenance used to live in help= because that was the nearest
# container, and 31 tooltips grew to 22,771 characters of citations,
# quotations, measured frequencies and superseded readings -- served
# as hover text, which cannot be scrolled, selected or searched.
#
# Three depths, and the layers each is served in. GLANCE: what this
# is, in the tooltip -- one sentence, about 200 characters the aim;
# the guard test (tests/test_text_lengths_2026_09_17.py) holds help=
# and glance= to a ceiling of 300 and a caption to 400. CHECK: the
# citation, as a visible caption under the heading (standing · source),
# plus the row's own Source and Standing columns where the table
# carries them; then, visible above the table and at reading width,
# the SUMMARY (one or two sentences: what the reader is looking at)
# and the QUALIFICATIONS (short bold-led statements the result cannot
# be read without -- "This app's synthesis.", "Display only." --
# supplied by the call, never inferred from the rows). AUDIT: the
# quotations, the alternatives and the measurements, in the notes
# expander under the table, as headed sections (note_sections) at
# reading width, or as one Markdown string (notes=) where a block has
# not been divided yet; and, for a row too long for its cell, a
# selectbox under the table that prints one row's fields whole
# (detail= and detail_key=). The largest dossiers place further
# expanders after the finding themselves (_notes_expander), never
# nested. Nothing in these layers reads the chart: every status and
# value comes from the engine's rows.

# it, so a result on a screen could not be reproduced by another machine or

# calculation. No source text beyond the citations and notes the pages
# already print: the translations are copyrighted and stay out of it.

The two condition columns, If in a suitable condition and If in a bad condition, are this app's paraphrases of Abu Ma'shar's Book II chapters on the lord of the year in the houses of the circle (Saturn II.6, Jupiter II.9, Mars II.12, the Sun II.15, Venus II.18, Mercury II.21), applied to natal planets -- that application is the reading of the TNAC Reference Guide for the Planets and Places (Dykes, 2023), and this app follows it and says so. Every PN IV half has text; the Moon has no Book II houses chapter (II.22, 13 says to judge her in the manner of the rest of the planets, and the translator's note there points to VII.8, her transit through the twelve houses), and her two halves point to her own table below, since VII.8 supplies no condition split. The arrangement -- seven planets in twelve places -- is the Guide's; the wording of no column is."),

Ch. 57's sentences on the malefics or the benefics in a house are entered for Saturn and Mars, or for Jupiter and Venus, labelled general malefic or general benefic testimony for the class sentences; the four named pairs are joint configurations, indexed under both members as one testimony. Firmicus's portionally is printed after the entry, and is carried from the place's opening sentence where the cited run refers back to it (so put, in this place, in that place); a restated pivot or such a back-reference inherits, while 'in this sign' and 'generally' do not. A planet's own dignity or sign is a placement, not a configuration. Where the two authors disagree, both entries stand. A cell whose entries run past about sixty words prints only the entries that do not rest on a configuration and says how many it left to the row's detail: select a planet's row in the table above the readings and every entry of its list is printed in full beneath it. Named pairs require both planets and their stated configuration; the eighth-house Jupiter–Venus sentence has uncertain Node scope, Jupiter II.9.15 uses a translator-supplied 'not' with a possible 'even if received' reading, and entries stating no reception or affliction condition are identified as such rather than silently assigned one."),

Dykes's notes to III.13 supply Rhetorius's Moon in the fifth and seventh where Firmicus's own sentences are lost, entered as Rhetorius, as summarized by Dykes; Rhetorius's Moon in the sixth, eighth and twelfth is lost in the manuscripts, and his sixth-house transfer of the Sun's sentence to the mother stands for her there. The list holds 355 indexed entries (351 distinct source passages, since the four joint passages are indexed twice): 198 by Rhetorius, 153 by Firmicus and 4 by Dykes's summary; no cell is without one -- a dash, where a cell had none, would be the absence of testimony, not a neutral reading."),

A paired house cites the pair's sentence and names the sharing; Saturn's four falling places (II.6, 22-24), Jupiter's four places not looking at the Ascendant (II.9, 15-16) and Venus falling from the stakes (II.18, 18) are carried whole beside each house's own sentence, with their premise in the revolution.
