"""The Chart page with the wheel at centre stage.

The owner's ruling: the wheel centred and larger, the four controls in one
row beneath it, the three introductory sentences beneath those, and the
header metrics row gone -- its lunation moved into the chart strip, which
every page carries.

These tests read the rendered page's element order, not only its source, so
the arrangement itself is pinned: the wheel block, then the controls block,
then the four sentences (body text at reading width in one container since
readability branch B, 2026-09-17; captions before that).
