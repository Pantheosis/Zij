"""The engine's move into engine.py, and the readings that moved with it.

Two things are proved here. The third, the migration's own differential --
every evaluator run on main's engine half and on engine.py over all six
fixture charts and both values of every switch -- is retired: main's app.py
has had no engine half above the UI marker since the split merged, so the
test could only skip. Its run is recorded in process/tae_docs/ENGINE_SPLIT_2026-09-15.md.

**The readings, by value.** One test per reading, asserting that the two
values produce *different* evaluator output -- the gap that let the first
attempt at this split pass its whole suite while every switch was silently
dead, the readings having been assigned into app.py's namespace where no
engine function could see them. Each also runs the two values in two
threads at once and asserts each thread sees its own, which is the reason
the readings are thread-local rather than module globals: Streamlit runs
every session's script in a thread of its own against one imported engine.

**The fixed stars.** The catalogue is attached per thread, because Swiss
Ephemeris keeps its ephemeris path in thread-local state. A second thread
must place as many stars as the first.
