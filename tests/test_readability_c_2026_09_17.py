"""The four Prediction pages, readability branch C (2026-09-17), migrated
onto the renderer contract of branch A: what each block now renders, from
the same rows it rendered before, and how the engine's six note constants
are shown in paragraphs without a character of engine.py changing.

Nothing here tests doctrine; the engine is byte-identical to main. Each
test reads a page as AppTest renders it and checks the presentation the
branch promises: the visible summary and qualifications at reading width,
the headed notes with the book icon, the comparison tables' rows against
the sentences they were built from, a detail selectbox whose options are
the displayed table's column in order, the wheel legend's letters against
the badges the wheel is drawn with, correction 9b's wording, and every
_paragraphs() site rejoining to its constant.
