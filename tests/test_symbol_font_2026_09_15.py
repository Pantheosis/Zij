"""The embedded symbol font (process/tae_docs/UI_CHANGES_2026-09-15_symbol_font.md).

Item 13 of `UI_FRAMEWORK_REVIEW_2026-09-15_SECOND_OPINION.md` (brief #8's
second half): `glyph_font.py` carries two subset WOFF2 faces, base64, family
'TAE Symbols'; the four renderers write a `<style>` element with
`font_face_css()` right after their opening `<svg>` tag and put the family
first in `_WHEEL_FONT`'s stack. Nothing else moves. Three things could each
break quietly and are each held to a proof here:

1. **The picture is the picture it always was.** Strip the `<style>` block
   and the embedded family name from `style="font-family:..."` and what is
   left is `main`'s SVG, byte for byte, for the default chart on all four
   renderers.
2. **Every glyph the renderers draw from SIGN_GLYPHS, POINT_GLYPHS and
   _ASPECT_GLYPH is covered by the embedded font -- with one documented
   exception.** The Lot of Fortune's own glyph (U+2297, circled times) is in
   neither of the two source files this branch was told to subset from
   (`glyph_font.py`'s docstring has the full finding); a genuinely new
   uncovered glyph -- one that is not that documented exception -- fails
   this test loudly rather than shipping quietly.
3. **The subsets are what they claim to be.** Each embedded base64 blob
   decodes to bytes beginning with WOFF2's own magic, and its font, opened
   with `fontTools`, maps exactly the code points `glyph_font.COVERED`
   claims for it -- skipped when `fontTools` is not installed, since it is
   deliberately not a dependency of the app itself.
