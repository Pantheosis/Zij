"""Sahl's worked question chart -- On Questions Ch. 1, 53-65, Figures 33-34.

The corpus's only dated, located, fully worked chart, and the one place
Sahl states the positions, the method and the judgments together. Every
assertion here is one of his own sentences, run against the engine on the
longitudes HE gives (¶54), never on positions recomputed from the date:
Figure 34's reconstruction (5 July 824 JC, 03:18:10 LMT, Baghdad) is in a
Sassanian sidereal frame, and recomputing tropically would move every body
by ~3.6 degrees. Whole-sign relations are frame-independent, which is why
literal longitudes are the right input.

    "the Ascendant was Gemini, 20; and the Midheaven Pisces, the first
    degree; and the Sun in Cancer, 12; and the Moon in Virgo, 17; and
    Mercury in Gemini, 27; and Mars in Taurus, 8; and Venus in Leo, 3; and
    Jupiter in Pisces, in 20, stationing toward retrogradation; and Saturn
    in Gemini, in 6." (¶54)

Two provenance notes. ¶61's "stationing toward retrogradation" is a fact
Sahl states, not one derivable from the nine longitudes: it enters as
Jupiter's near-zero speed and is not asserted. ¶65's "Jupiter is with the
Tail" is likewise not derivable from ¶54 -- the nodes are not among his
figures -- so the Tail is hardcoded from Figure 34 (☋ 25 Pisces 46', the
TRUE node; the mean node would be 26 38'), and asserted at sign level only.

The 2026-09-07 bounds correction changes one lordship in this chart --
Saturn at 6 Gemini is now in Jupiter's bound, not Venus's -- and no
judgment Sahl draws touches it. Mercury at 27 Gemini is in Saturn's bound
under both tables.
