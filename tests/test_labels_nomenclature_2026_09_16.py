"""The independent review's naming and status findings (F07, F09, F10, F11, F15).

F10 renames two columns of the aspects table and turns the third from a
Yes/No into a named state. The states are the ones the two connection tests
actually decide and no others: the tests themselves are untouched, and
``Rules differ`` still compares their booleans, which is pinned here so a
display change cannot quietly become a doctrine change.

F07 separates the end of a bounded search from an absence, F09 carries the
circumpolar approximation with the hour lord onto every page, F15 reconciles
three pieces of help with what the app does, and F11 gives the four
classical Lots the provenance rows their own note promises.
