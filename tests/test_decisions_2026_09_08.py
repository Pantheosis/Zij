    PN IV, so this control is no longer "nothing reads PLANETARY_YEARS" --
    pn4_fardar_sequence now reads it. What it guards is narrower.

    The LESSER, MIDDLE, GREATER and MIGHTY years are applied by ONE reader
    only: sahl_house_master_years (FINAL-A1, owner 2026-09-11), which grants
    the house-master its years from Sahl, On Nativities 1.20, 7-34. PN IV
    does not say which planet is the house-master or how many years it
    grants (IX.8, 123); On Times 4, 7 is a question-chart rule; 1.20 is the
    corpus's one natal grant. Nothing else may choose a row of that table.
    The FARDAR column is a different kind of number, a period length rather
    than a grant, and IV.1, 2 gives it outright.

    TWO CHECKS, and they catch different things. The key-level one runs
    first so that a genuine attempt to apply a grant gets the doctrinal
    message rather than the generic one; the by-name one then catches any
    new reader however it spells the read -- .get("greater"), a variable
    subscript, unpacking -- which the key-level check cannot see.

    IF THIS FAILS ON WORK YOU BELIEVE IS CORRECT: no regex can tell
    "applies a grant to a judgment" from "derives a displayed quantity",
    and the sets above are the place that decision is recorded. Deriving
    the Ages of Man from I.8, 9's rule, or III.7, 32-42's activation ages,
    would both land here legitimately. Applying a house-master's years as
