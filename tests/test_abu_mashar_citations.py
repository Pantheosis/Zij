"""Every 'VII.N, P' citation of Abu Ma'shar's Great Introduction Book VII in
app.py must name a chapter that exists and a paragraph the chapter has.

Book VII's OCR carries the paragraph pin that On Nativities' could not: its
sentence numbers are clean, run 1..max per chapter, and its footnotes are
numbered continuously across the book, so a bare "44" is never a footnote.
The 2026-09-08 audit (process/tae_docs/synthesis/11_abu_mashar_citation_audit.md) found
"VII.3, 19-20" (VII.3 ends at 11) -- this pin would have caught it -- and
"VII.5, 120" for the Resistance sentence at 118, which no range pin can.

MAX_PARAGRAPH is vendored from the full volume gr_intr/abu_mashar_great_
introduction.md (derived by script, each value checked against the
reading); with the corpus on disk a third test re-derives it from the file.
