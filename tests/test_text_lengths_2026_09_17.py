"""Ceilings on the length of the app's tooltip and caption text, with a
frozen allowlist that can only shrink.

The renderer's own comment sets out three depths for one finding: the
GLANCE is what the thing is, said in a sentence in the heading's tooltip;
the CHECK is the citation, a visible caption; the AUDIT is the quotations
and measurements, in an expander under the table. A tooltip cannot be
scrolled, selected or searched, so a glance or a help string is a
sentence, and a caption is provenance, not an essay. The renderer's
comment names about 200 characters as the aim for a tooltip; the numbers
here are ceilings, not the aim: help and glance at 300, caption at 400.

The scan is by AST over app.py, so it sees only what the source states
as text: a string constant; an f-string's constant parts (the
interpolations count for nothing); a ``+`` chain of those; a
``.format(...)`` call measured as its receiver; a bare name, when app.py
assigns it exactly once at module level to something the scan can
measure, measured as that value, so a tooltip lifted to a module constant
does not leave the guard. Names app.py takes from engine.py through its
star import stay unmeasured by design: the engine's note constants are
the last readability branch's (C) business, and this test does not read
engine.py. Anything else measures 0 and is ignored, so a caption built at
run time from a local is not this test's business. The measured text is
the constant parts concatenated in order.

ALLOWED_LONG froze the first 48 characters of every string over its
ceiling as the app stood when the tuple was generated (90 entries), and
the readability branches A, B and C deleted them block by block; it is
empty since C. Three tests: no string over its ceiling whose key is not
in the tuple (with the tuple empty, no string over its ceiling at all);
every entry in the tuple still names an offender, so the list can only
shrink; and the tuple is empty. To see any offenders run this module as
a script:

    python tests/test_text_lengths_2026_09_17.py

which prints the current offenders, one per line, as kind, ceiling,
length and key; the test is never self-updating.
