"""The P2 blocks outside Prediction, readability branch B (2026-09-17),
migrated onto the renderer contract of branch A: what each block now
renders, from the same rows it rendered before.

Nothing here tests doctrine; the engine is byte-identical to main. Each
test reads the page as AppTest renders it and checks the presentation the
branch promises: the visible summary and qualifications above a table, the
headed notes with the book icon, a detail selectbox whose options are the
displayed table's column in order and which prints the chosen row whole,
the threshold table built from the engine's constants, the readings note
with its count and list, and the two Dignities cross-references.
