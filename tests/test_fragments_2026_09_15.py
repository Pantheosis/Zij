"""The picture controls as fragments.

Item 9 of `UI_FRAMEWORK_REVIEW_2026-09-15_SECOND_OPINION.md`. Every control
on a wheel used to rerun the whole script: the Chart page's layout radio,
Bounds ring, Dark wheel and download, and the Timing page's view selectbox,
layout radio and the five controls in its Options popover -- the last of
which redrew all 67 tables on that page for a toggle that moves a picture.
Each wheel and its controls are one `@st.fragment` now, and a fragment
reruns only its own body on its own widgets' changes.

What `AppTest` can and cannot show. It runs a fragment as part of a full
run, so the saving itself -- the partial rerun -- is not visible here and
was measured in the browser instead (see
`process/tae_docs/UI_CHANGES_2026-09-15_fragments.md`). What is visible here, and is
what would break silently, is the shape the fragment has to keep:

1. the two functions exist and carry the decorator;
2. the wheel still renders, on both pages and both layouts;
3. the store keys the fragment's widgets write are left in the state a full
   rerun would have produced -- because the top level reads them on the NEXT
   full run (`CHART_BOUNDS`, `WHEEL_DARK`), and a fragment that wrote only
   its widget key would strand them;
4. every element the fragment draws is inside its body. A fragment may not
   write to a container outside itself, and Streamlit renders one as a block
   of its own, so this reads as: the fragment's elements are that block's
   children, contiguous by construction, and nothing the fragment is
   responsible for stands outside it.

# unchanged by the split of 2026-09-17, which took three tabs to pages of
# their own and left the year block (subheader, columns) where it stood.
# The readings note under the chart strip is a fixed st.empty() slot since

# tabs shifted them), unfilled on the default chart, so the fragment is
# main's fourth child and everything after the strip stands one later.
# On the Timing page the true-Sun qualification stands at reading width
# between the first tab's subheader and its table since readability
# branch C, so the fragment is that tab's fourth child.
