"""Executable/.streamlit/config.toml, and the AST fact behind it.

The app had no config file in Executable/, so the live server showed the
Deploy button and every AppTest render paid for the magic rewrite it never
used -- the script has no bare expression statement anywhere (checked here
by AST, not by eye), so turning magic off changes nothing on a page. The
config file and tests/conftest.py's own `runner.magicEnabled` setting (set
before the first AppTest is built, so the suite does not depend on the
working directory) both carry the same fact.
