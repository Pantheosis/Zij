"""Sahl: indications of fortune and livelihood (On Nativities Ch. 2) -- the
synthesis from the first and second lords of the sect light's triplicity
(2.11, 1-5), the partnering lord (2.11, 4; 2.3, 22), the Lot step (2.3, 6-9;
2.16; 2.20) -- against Abu 'Ali's twelve worked charts (PN I, JN Ch. 7,
Figures 10-21).

The fixtures' evidential status. Each chart is built from what Abu 'Ali
PRINTS: the signs of the planets and of the Ascendant, and the degrees only
where his text gives them (Figures 16 and 18-21; his ordinal words are taken
as the numbers, "the eighth degree, fourth minute" as 8.07, and Dykes's wheel
prints each one degree lower). An unprinted degree is unknown: the sign-only
charts (Figures 10-15, 17) put every planet at 0 of its sign for the whole-
sign place alone, and nothing that depends on that 0 is asserted of them --
no burning or rays, no application or separation, no degree-angularity, no
ascensional grade, and no Lot of Fortune, since a Lot computed from unprinted
degrees could stand in any one of three signs (the Ascendant, the Moon and
the Sun each anywhere in its sign, the sum ranges over ninety degrees); those
charts carry no Lot. A sign-only lord printed in the Sun's sign is not judged
for the rays at all: at 0 with him the app reads it in his heart, at any real
separation under the orb under the rays, and the printed sign cannot tell --
so Figure 10's Venus, Figure 11's Mercury, Figure 17's Mercury and Saturn,
Figure 14's Mercury and Saturn and Figure 15's Moon are asserted by place
alone, and Figure 11 pins no synthesis, the 0 deciding it. A planet printed
with its sign only in a degree chart (Figure 21's Mars) is at 0 for the same
reason. Six of the twelve are internally inconsistent by
Dykes's own notes or by the printed signs against Abu 'Ali's words (Figures
14, 15, 16, 18, 21; Figure 20's rise rests on grounds Sahl does not state,
and fn 60 warns of calculation errors in its Lot): those six are textual
observations -- they assert the places the app reads from the printed signs
and that the synthesis is NOT the verdict Abu 'Ali states, with Dykes's note
in the message, and pin no expected class. The other six assert the lords'
places, strong or falling, the partnering lord's effect, the Lot's place
where it is printed, and the synthesis.
