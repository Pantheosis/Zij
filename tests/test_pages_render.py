"""Every page renders without exception on every chart, and renders exactly
the tables the fixture says it does -- as a multiset of (heading, columns),
not a count. Counting st.dataframe calls is what passed commit 3dbf4af,
which lost two tables and duplicated two others.

To accept a deliberate change to the set of tables:

    UPDATE_TABLE_FIXTURE=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_pages_render.py

then read the diff of tests/fixtures/tables.json before committing it. Serially: the
writer is per session, so under xdist each worker would write only its own slots, and
conftest refuses an update run that has -n.
