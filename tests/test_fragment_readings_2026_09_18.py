"""A fragment rerun evaluates under the run's own readings.

The readings are per run and per thread (PR #45): app.py pins them at the
top of each run with engine.set_readings and every evaluator asks through
engine.reading(), which falls back to the module default in a thread that
has pinned nothing. Five blocks of the pages are @st.fragment bodies (the
fragments of 2026-09-15), and a click on one of their own widgets reruns
the body alone -- in a fresh ScriptRunner thread whenever the previous
run's runner has stopped, which is the ordinary case, the reader clicking
after the page has rendered. The top level does not execute on such a
rerun, so nothing pinned, and the Timing wheel's Lots ring -- the one
fragment path that reaches an evaluator reading a reading, lot_by_id and
LOT_HOUSE_CUSP -- drew the house-based Lots at the whole-sign cusps under a
'quadrant cusp' run: assets, travel and enemies moved by 9-15 degrees on
1240-05-23 Florence while the two death Lots, which carry their own cusp
rule, stood (G18 of the doctrine audit, both readers, 2026-09-17/18).

The fix: every fragment is declared with app.py's _pinned_fragment, which
is st.fragment with the run's recorded pins (_RUN_READINGS, filled by
_pin_readings at both pin sites) re-pinned in the rerun's thread before
the body runs. The body Streamlit stores is a closure over the full run
that declared it, so the record it reads is that run's.

What is pinned here:

A. Behaviour, on Streamlit's own server path -- a full run under AppTest,
   then a fragment-only rerun of the stored fragment through a second
   LocalScriptRunner sharing the first run's fragment storage and session
   state, with RerunData(fragment_id_queue=[...]) as AppSession.request_rerun
   sends it, in a new thread (the readers' C-FR recipe):
   1. the Timing wheel's cusp-based Lots have the same longitudes on the
      fragment rerun as on the full run, and lot_by_id sees the run's
      LOT_HOUSE_CUSP there;
   2. the Chart wheel's renderer, the engine function that fragment reaches,
      runs under every one of the run's readings on the rerun;
   3. every fragment of every page that has one, rerun alone, pins exactly
      the run's readings in its own thread before its body -- the planets
      block on Dignities and the two tick grids on Configurations reach no
      engine function, so this is their probe.
   Each fails at main (9476d8b): the rerun's thread reads the defaults.
B. Structure, by AST over app.py, so a future fragment cannot regress
   silently: every fragment is declared with _pinned_fragment and no other
   way; st.fragment is called once, inside it; the wrapper pins the record
   before it calls the body; every engine.set_readings in the file goes
   through _pin_readings or the wrapper, so the record is complete; and no
   doctrinal reading's control stands inside a fragment, which is the
   premise that a reading cannot move without a full run.

Every AppTest here runs under the harness's scratch XDG_DATA_HOME and with
preferences off (conftest); the engine's functions are wrapped AFTER
make_app, which is where the harness reloads the engine.
