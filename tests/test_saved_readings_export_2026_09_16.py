"""The readings a chart is saved with, and the analysis export.

F03 and F08 of the independent UI review of 2026-09-16, with E04 as the
acceptance case: save a chart under Abu Ma'shar's connection rule, change
the rule to Sahl, load the chart again. The review found Sahl still in
force with nothing said. From this branch the record carries the readings
it was saved under, the load says which it is doing, and an Export analysis
action writes what was entered, what was in force, what was computed and
what computed it.

Everything here runs against a tmp_path XDG directory, never the real one.
