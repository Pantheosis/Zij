"""Regression harness for Executable/engine.py and Executable/app.py.

The app is two files: ``engine.py``, the calculation engine, and ``app.py``,
which takes it whole through ``from engine import *`` and carries the
Streamlit pages from the marker ``# 4. STREAMLIT UI INTEGRATION`` onward.
Two ways in:

* ``engine`` -- ``engine.py`` imported as a module and handed to the test as
  its namespace, so constants and evaluators can be inspected without a
  Streamlit run.
* ``make_app()`` -- ``streamlit.testing.v1.AppTest`` driving the whole script
  headless: no browser, no port. One call renders ONE page (Streamlit runs
  the script once per page), so tests parametrise over pages.

Both files are located relative to this file, so the suite runs from any
checkout or CI runner. (It used to hard-code the developer's absolute path
to dodge a stale ``app.py`` one directory up; that file is gone.)
