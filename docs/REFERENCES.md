# References — the texts and data this app relies on

The texts the app's rules come from, what each supplies, and how each is cited on the page.
The texts themselves are not in this repository (see the note at the end).

**Standing.** *Canon* is the course's own texts (Sahl I and PN IV) and the course materials.
*Supplement* is Abū Ma'shar's *Great Introduction*, shown beside Sahl's tables when the Sources
page's control says so. *Witness* texts were brought in on 2026-09-14/15 and serve three roles
only: to disambiguate a reading the canon left open, to answer a question the canon is silent on
(built at supplement depth or as a note), or to stand beside a canon value where sources
disagree — never to replace one. Nothing is built past what the course actually teaches.

**How citations are written on the page.** A locator names its volume, never the author alone:
*Sahl, The Introduction Ch. 3, 85*; *Sahl, On Nativities 1.22, 9*; *Gr. Intr. VII.6, 27*;
*PN IV IX.1, 26* (bare *Book.chapter, sentence* on the Timing page, whose rules all come from that
book); *ITA I.22 (al-Qabisi)* with al-Qabīsī's own numbering where given; *Abbr. II.27* for Abū
Ma'shar's *Abbreviation* as ITA prints it; *Abu Bakr, On Nativities II.5.14*; *'Umar al-Tabari,
Book of Nativities I.4.3*; *Masha'allah, Book of Aristotle III.1.8*; *Abu 'Ali al-Khayyat,
Judgments of Nativities Ch. 4*; *Rhetorius Ch. 27 (Holden)* and, for the planets-in-houses
column, *Ch. 57, the sixth, p. 76* (chapter, house, Holden's page — he has no sentence numbers;
`pp. 57-61` where a half folds in the house's earlier sentences, `pp. 65, 88-89` where it draws on a
reassigned page);
*Mathesis III.7, 26* (Dykes); *Valens, Anthologies II.36 (Riley)*; *Morin, Astrologia Gallica
21.II.X (Holden)*; *Carmen I.28, 5* (Dykes). Page text carries no build process and no course
citation ("Lesson", "Handy Tables", "Course Glossary") — the one exception is the Reference Guide,
named once on each of the two delineation tables as the arrangement's origin.

## 1. Course materials — Benjamin N. Dykes, *Traditional Natal Astrology Course* (TNAC)

| Work | What the app takes from it | Cited on the page |
|---|---|---|
| *The TNAC Reference Guide for the Planets and Places* (April 2023, 40 pp.) | The arrangement of the two delineation tables on the Dignities page — "Topical Planets in Houses" (Rhetorius / PN IV halves per planet per house) and "Topical House Lords (Masha'allah)" (the lord of each place in each place) — and its reading that PN IV Book II's *lord of the year* in the places applies to natal planets. Since builds A–C the wording of every cell is this app's own paraphrase of the source texts; the Guide's summary wording no longer survives in any cell. | Once per table, as the arrangement's origin |
| *TNAC Handy Tables from Part 1* (2023, 35 pp., Lessons 5–20) | The Egyptian bounds table (p. 1), read cell by cell; the Lesson 20 victor worksheet (Ibn Ezra's almuten scoring — his own book is not in hand, so the course sheet is the source); the Lesson 5 chart-worksheet lines the sect and obliquity computations follow. | No (code comments and tests only) |
| Course Glossary and Lessons 3, 5, 10, 15–17, 20 | Definitions the code comments hold the app to (Domain, Eastern, Advancement, angles/succedents/cadents, the stakes reading of the five-degree rule). | No |

| **Jean-Baptiste Morin**, *Astrologia Gallica* Book 21, Sec. II, Ch. X, trans. Holden (pp. 105–110) | The aspects of benefics and malefics into fortunate and unfortunate houses — Morin's phrase for each case; the 6th, 8th and 12th taken as the unfortunate houses is this app's reading, said so on the page. | "Morin's rules" on the Findings page, display only. |
