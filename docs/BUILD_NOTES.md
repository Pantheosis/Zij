# Packaging Zij as a portable desktop app

## Files
- `desktop_launcher.py` — spawns Streamlit headlessly, opens it in a pywebview window.
- `build.spec` — PyInstaller build configuration.
- `app.py` — the Streamlit script, bundled as a data file (not imported).

## 1. Test in dev mode first
Before packaging anything:
```
pip install pywebview
python desktop_launcher.py
```
This should open a native window showing the app. Fix any issues here —
they'll be much harder to debug once frozen.

## 2. Why onedir instead of onefile
PyInstaller's `--onefile` mode self-extracts to a temp directory on *every
launch*, adding a real startup delay, and its unsigned self-extracting
`.exe`s are flagged by antivirus heuristics far more often than a plain
folder of files. `build.spec` uses `--onedir` (via `COLLECT`) instead:

- **Windows:** the build is a folder (`dist/Zij/`) containing
  `Zij.exe` plus its dependencies. Zip the folder — that *is* the
  portable, no-install form. Users unzip and double-click the `.exe`.
- **macOS:** the spec's `BUNDLE` step wraps that same folder into a proper
  `Zij.app`, which behaves as a single double-clickable icon even
  though it's technically a directory. Zip or `.dmg` it for distribution.

If a folder of files is unwanted, `--onefile` still
works for personal use — change `EXE(..., exclude_binaries=True)`
to a single onefile `EXE(...)` per PyInstaller's docs and drop `COLLECT`.

## 3. Platform-specific requirements

### Windows
pywebview uses the **Qt (PySide6/QtWebEngine)** backend, which bundles its
own Chromium build via the `PySide6` pip package — no external runtime
dependency like WebView2, no version detection, nothing to install on the
end user's machine beyond the app itself.

Unsigned `.exe`s trigger a Windows SmartScreen warning ("Windows protected
your PC"). Users can click **More info → Run anyway**. A proper fix requires
a code-signing certificate (~$100+/yr) — not necessary for personal/private
distribution.

### macOS
pywebview uses the built-in WebKit — no extra runtime needed, which is a
genuine advantage for portability here.

Unsigned `.app` bundles trigger Gatekeeper's "unidentified developer"
block. First run: **right-click the app → Open → Open** (this only needs
doing once). Removing that friction needs an Apple Developer ID ($99/yr)
and a notarized build; the releases are not notarized.

## 4. Gotchas specific to this app's dependencies

- **Windows GUI backend: Qt (PySide6), not WebView2.** Earlier versions of
  this project used pywebview's EdgeChromium backend, which depends on the
  Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime being present on the end user's machine
  (usually true on stock Windows 10/11, but not guaranteed — debloated
  installs, locked-down corporate images, or older systems can be missing
  it entirely, and there's no way to know in advance whose machine it'll
  run on). We switched to pywebview's Qt backend instead: `PySide6`
  bundles its own complete Chromium build (QtWebEngine) directly in the
  pip wheel, so there's nothing external to detect, download, or bundle
  separately — `pip install -r requirements.txt` is the whole story.
  `desktop_launcher.py` forces `gui="qt"` on Windows; macOS keeps using
  its native Cocoa/WebKit backend, since that already works well there
  with no equivalent runtime-availability problem.
- **pyswisseph / ephemeris precision:** the planets run on the built-in
  Moshier ephemeris (no external `.se1` files needed). This is
  arc-second-level precision, which is far finer than anything the app
  displays (minutes of arc) — no need to bundle Swiss Ephemeris planetary
  files unless there is a specific reason to want JPL-grade precision.
  The invariant that matters is that NO `.se1` FILE IS BUNDLED OR NEEDED
  and the planets stay on Moshier; `app.py` does call
  `swe.set_ephe_path()`, once, in `_fixed_star_catalogue_ready`, but only
  at a directory holding nothing Swiss Ephemeris would read for a planet,
  so `FLG_SWIEPH` planet calls find no planetary file there and fall back
  to Moshier exactly as before (pinned by the flag test:
  `swe.calc_ut(2451545.0, swe.MARS)[1] == 260`, Moshier + speed). Since
  2026-09-11 the app SHIPS the star catalogue: `ephe/sefstars.txt` (137 KB,
  the Swiss Ephemeris fixed-star file, copied unmodified from the
  `kerykeion` package, which redistributes it under AGPL-3.0 — the app's
  own licence; see `ephe/README.md`). `app.py` looks for it there first,
  beside itself (`Path(__file__).parent / "ephe"`, the same way it reads
  `atlas.db`) and points the ephemeris at that directory DIRECTLY — no
  symlink, no copy, no writable user directory (the first Windows build
  of the branch failed exactly there: the symlink-or-copy into
  `%APPDATA%` and the swallowed exception printed "no catalogue is
  available" while the file was in the bundle). Only a catalogue found
  elsewhere (`$SE_EPHE_PATH`, the user data directory, a site-packages
  scan) is linked, or copied where links are not allowed, into a private
  `<user data dir>/ephe_stars/`. `build.spec` lists the file in `datas`
  so the frozen app carries it at `_internal/ephe/sefstars.txt`. The
  fixed-star tables (PN IV I.6, 7 and III.8, 9) therefore render
  identically on every checkout and in the frozen app; when the page
  says "Not computed" it now also says WHY (the path looked at, or the
  file found and the exception Swiss Ephemeris raised), so a failing
  build can be diagnosed from the screenshot.
- **timezonefinder:** ships a sizeable internal dataset (tens of MB) that
  `collect_all("timezonefinder")` in `build.spec` should pull in
  automatically. This is the single biggest contributor to final build
  size. For a much smaller build at the cost of coarser timezone
  boundaries, `TimezoneFinderL` is a lighter drop-in alternative; it
  trades accuracy for size and is not used.
- **Geocoding is offline.** Place lookup reads the bundled `atlas.db`
  (SQLite, ~24 MB, listed in `build.spec`'s `datas`), so the packaged app
  needs no internet access and no geopy/Nominatim or certifi -- neither is
  a dependency any more, and neither is in `requirements*.txt` or the spec.
  Swapping the atlas for a live geocoder would bring both back:
  a network requirement at runtime, and certifi's CA bundle for frozen
  HTTPS calls.

## 5. Building for both platforms without owning both machines
PyInstaller does not cross-compile — a build run on Linux/Mac cannot
produce a Windows `.exe`, and vice versa. Without both machines the
standard solution is a CI matrix, which this repository has:
`.github/workflows/build.yml` runs on `windows-latest` and `macos-latest`,
installs `requirements-desktop.txt` plus PyInstaller, runs `pyinstaller
build.spec`, and zips `dist/`. How it is triggered and where the zips go
is in `docs/RELEASING.md`.

## 6. Debugging a frozen build that fails silently
Set `console=True` in `build.spec` temporarily — this gives a terminal
window showing Streamlit's actual startup errors/tracebacks, which are
otherwise invisible with `console=False`. Switch back to `False` for the
release build once it's working.
