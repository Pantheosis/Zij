"""
desktop_launcher.py
Packages app.py (Zīj) as a native desktop window
using pywebview, with Streamlit running as a local, headless subprocess.

DEV MODE (no packaging, just testing the desktop shell):
    pip install pywebview
    python desktop_launcher.py

PACKAGED MODE:
    Build with `pyinstaller build.spec`. Must be run separately ON Windows
    (produces a .exe) and ON macOS (produces a .app) -- PyInstaller does not
    cross-compile between platforms. See docs/BUILD_NOTES.md.

HOW THIS WORKS INSIDE A FROZEN (PyInstaller) BUILD:
A frozen build has no separate `python`/`streamlit` binary to shell out to --
the interpreter and this script are merged into one executable. So instead,
this same executable re-invokes ITSELF (via sys.executable, which points at
the frozen exe/app itself once packaged) with a hidden sentinel flag. That
child process detects the flag and runs Streamlit's CLI in-process instead
of opening a window. The parent process waits for that server to come up,
then opens a pywebview window pointed at it.

    factors: window sizing/positioning all operates in DPI-independent
    ("logical") pixels, and logical screen resolution shrinks as the scale
    factor climbs -- e.g. a 3840x2400 panel at 300% scaling has only
