# These packages ship data files, C extensions, or dynamic imports that
# static analysis alone won't find -- pull in everything for each.
# NOTE: "webview" (pywebview's actual import name -- not the "pywebview"
# distribution name) was MISSING from this list entirely in earlier
# versions of this spec. pywebview's platform backends (edgechromium.py,
# winforms.py, mshtml.py, cocoa.py, etc.) are imported dynamically inside
# functions in guilib.py, which PyInstaller's static analysis can't see --
# so without explicitly collecting them, some backends silently never
# make it into the bundle at all. That's what caused pywebview to keep
# falling through to the broken legacy WinForms/IE renderer even after
# explicitly forcing gui="edgechromium" in desktop_launcher.py: the
# edgechromium backend module itself wasn't present to import.
# NOTE: pyswisseph's PyPI distribution name and its actual import name
# ("swisseph") differ -- listing "pyswisseph" here silently collects
# nothing, since collect_all() operates on the importable module name, not
# the PyPI package name. This went unnoticed for a while because every
# earlier build crashed (on pywebview issues) before app.py ever got far
# enough to actually execute `import swisseph`.

# catalogue the app ships (AGPL-3.0, see ephe/README.md); app.py looks for it
# first, beside itself, exactly as it reads atlas.db, and points the

# effect if it runs before the *first* GDI/window-related Win32 call
# anywhere in the process, and nothing guarantees Python/PyInstaller's own
# startup hasn't already made one. Without either, Windows DPI-virtualizes
# an unaware process -- bitmap-scaling its window to compensate for display
# scaling while it still thinks it drew at the requested size/position --
# which is what made the window open oversized and shifted off-screen.
# Includes the common-controls dependency PyInstaller's own default
# manifest normally carries, so native controls keep the modern Windows
